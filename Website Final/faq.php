               <br>
               <li>I have been a coffee enthusiast my whole life and am passionate about the art of making it. After having worked at various coffee shops over the years, I finally decided to open my own shop. My goal was to create good tasting coffee with fresh ingredients to provide the superior cup of coffee. I also wanted to create a local spot that people could enjoy and socialize and still feel like they were at home. This led to me opening the first Love You A Latte shop. Since opening, we have been able to deliver the best customer service, a comfortable environment, and most importantly, the best tasting coffee.</li>
